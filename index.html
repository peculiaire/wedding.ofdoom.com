<h3>Who</h3>

<p>Well, us (Mark Ferlatte and Joy Scharmen), obviously. Mark's sister Christy Hartshorne is going to make sure he doesn't pass out and Joy's best friend Jeff Hungerford is going to make sure someone is wearing an <a href="http://wendybrandes.com/blog/2012/11/the-return-of-the-butt-bow/">ass bow</a>. Our dear friend Daniel &ldquo;DQ&rdquo; Quinlan is going to officiate.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>First, she asked him if they were on a date and he said yes. Later, he asked a question in the form of a statement and she said yes.</p> 

<p><i>No takebacks.</i></p>
