<h2>RSVP?</h2>
<p>Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1b2FNMtnw9Nm8XhUDvSB3H2NQVBqpiVApgVmyYLFeJEQ/viewform">RSVP over here</a>.</p>

<h2>Registry?</h2>
<p>We have a <a href="https://www.honeyfund.com/wedding/ofdoom">Honeyfund registry</a> and a <a href="https://secure.freedomtomarry.org/page/outreach/view/weddingregistry/ferlatte">Freedom to Marry</a> charity setup. Please feel free to give to either, both, or neither; we just want to see you there.</p>

<h2>When?</h2>
<p>29 June 2013 at 6PM followed by a reception.</p>

<h2>Where?</h2>
<p>Montague, CA. Specifically, on the <a href="http://mapq.st/YL3Ue4">ranch where Mark grew up</a>.</p>

<h2>Where should I stay?</h2>
<p>We've got a deal at the Best Western Miner's Inn in Yreka: call +1 (530) 842-4355 and press 0 to get Reservations. Reference "Mark and Joy wedding" for a cheaper rate.</p>
<p>We're setting up a shuttle between the hotel and the ranch to keep things easy. The ranch is about 25 minute away from Yreka.</p>

<h2>How should I get there?</h2>
<p>From San Francisco, it's about a 5 hour drive to the hotel.</p>
<p>The closest airport is Medford International (MFR); it's about 1 hour drive from there to Yreka (where the hotel is).</p>

<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>Well, us (Mark Ferlatte and Joy Scharmen), obviously. Mark's sister Christy Hartshorne is going to make sure he doesn't pass out and Joy's best friend Jeff Hungerford is going to make sure someone is wearing an <a href="http://wendybrandes.com/blog/2012/11/the-return-of-the-butt-bow/">ass bow</a>. Our dear friend Daniel &ldquo;DQ&rdquo; Quinlan is going to officiate.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>First, she asked him if they were on a date and he said yes. Later, he asked a question in the form of a statement and she said yes.</p> 

<p><em>No takebacks.</em></p>
